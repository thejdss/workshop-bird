# Mobile Game Development Workshop

Game developed during the workshop of development of mobile games with augmented reality at PUC Minas.

If you have a problem with Vulforia, try removing it from the project by going to:
`Build Settings > Project Settings > XR Settings`

Soon after you remove, add the Vulforia again and put the key and the unity package of the database image in the project, you can find the key and the database package of the image in this link:
[Key](key.txt) and
[Vulforia Database Package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EchVJc3Uyfbeq5n3MN8bwwxts01JsGEr/view?usp=sharing)

Or you can add your own database picture and your own key, remember to register at the Vulforia Developer website to get your own key and upload your desired image.

If you have problems completing the build, it might be the android SDK packages, so you should download the SDK Android Jelly Bean 4.2 in the Android Studio SDK Manager.

And if you want to test this application you can download it in this link: [Clone Bird APK](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16l86hROB6hFcDQnZjy1xFiQVwszqvRxo)

Good luck.
