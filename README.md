# Mobile Game Development Workshop

Game developed during the workshop of development of mobile games with augmented reality at PUC Minas.

If you have a problem with Vulforia, try removing it from the project by going to:
`Build Settings > Project Settings > XR Settings`

Soon after you remove, add the Vulforia again and put the key and the image in the project, you can find the key and the package of the image in this link:
[Key](key.txt) and
[Vulforia Database Package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EchVJc3Uyfbeq5n3MN8bwwxts01JsGEr/view?usp=sharing)

Or you can add your own picture and your own key.

If you have problems completing the build, it might be the android SDK packages, so you should download the SDK Android Jelly Bean 4.2 in the Android Studio SDK Manager.

Good luck.
